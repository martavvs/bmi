# Brain-Machine Interface


This presented project focuses on decoding the arm movement of a monkey utilising, as input, the neural activity recorded from the brain. The aim was to both understand the location of the object the animal was reaching and the trajectory of its arm. 

This problem was divided into two different steps:
- The algorithm had to decode the location of the object which requires a multi-class classification technique as there were 8 fixed angles the monkey could reach
- The arm position at every time-step (the trajectory) had to be defined. To do so a real time decoding technique was needed.
